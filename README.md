A full-stack 4-player Slovenian Tarok card game with AI agents that learn by
self-play using deep reinforcement learning (PPO). Play against trained AI
opponents in real time, watch AI-vs-AI spectator games, train new agents from
the browser dashboard, or run hyperparameter evolution and behavioral breeding
experiments.

## Features

- **Play vs AI** — Human-vs-3-AI games with per-opponent model selection,
  adjustable AI speed, and a live game log
- **Spectator mode** — Watch 4 AI agents play each other with full hand
  visibility and step-by-step playback
- **Training dashboard** — Start/stop PPO training runs, monitor win rate,
  reward, loss, bid distributions, and per-contract stats in real-time charts
- **Hyperparameter evolution** — DEAP-based population search over learning
  rate, entropy coefficient, discount factor, etc.
- **Behavioral breeding** — Genetic selection for play-style specialisation
  (aggressive bidder, solo specialist, …)
- **Tournament bracket** — Round-robin or bracket tournaments between any mix
  of RL, lookahead, and random agents
- **High-performance Rust engine** — Optional PyO3-based engine for legal-move
  generation, trick evaluation, and state encoding (10–100× faster than pure
  Python)

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript 5.6, Vite 6, Recharts |
| Backend | Python 3.12, FastAPI, Uvicorn, WebSockets |
| AI / ML | PyTorch 2.4+, PPO (actor-critic), DEAP |
| Engine | Rust (PyO3), optional high-perf game logic |
| Testing | Vitest + Testing Library (frontend unit), Playwright (E2E), pytest + pytest-bdd + Hypothesis (backend) |
| Dev | uv (pkg mgr), ruff (lint), pre-commit coverage gate |

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-time setup (macOS — installs Homebrew, Python, Node, uv, all deps)
make setup

# Start backend (port 8000) + frontend (port 3000)
make run
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Testing

```bash
make test              # All tests (backend + frontend typecheck + frontend unit)
make test-backend      # Backend pytest suite
make test-frontend     # TypeScript type-check
make test-frontend-unit # Vitest component tests
make test-e2e          # Playwright end-to-end tests
make test-coverage     # Backend coverage report
make test-quick        # Backend, fail-fast
```

## Training

```bash
make train             # 100 sessions × 100 games (PPO self-play)
make evolve            # DEAP hyperparameter search
make train-evolved     # Continue training with best evolved hparams
make breed             # Behavioral specialisation breeding
make train-bred        # Continue with best bred model
```

Or use the in-browser Training Dashboard (click "Train AI" on the home page).

## Game Rules (Slovenian Tarok, 4-player)

- **54 cards**: 22 Taroks (I–XXI + Škis) + 32 suit cards (4 suits × 8)
- **4 players**, each dealt 12 cards, 6 go to the talon
- **Bidding**: Players bid contracts (Three → Two → One → Solo Three → Solo Two → Solo One → Solo → Berač)
- **King Calling**: Declarer calls a king — the holder becomes their secret 2v2 partner
- **Talon Exchange**: Declarer picks talon cards and discards equal number
- **12 Tricks**: Must follow suit; must play tarok if void in led suit
- **Scoring**: Cards counted in groups of 3. Declarer team needs ≥36 of 70 points

## AI Agent

- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** with actor-critic architecture
- **179-feature state encoding**: hand (54), played cards (54), current trick (54), talon, contract, position
- **Masked action space**: 54-card output head filtered to legal moves
- **4-agent self-play**: all agents share one network
- **Mixed training**: optionally pit RL agents against StockŠkis heuristic or Lookahead (Monte Carlo) opponents

## Rust Engine (optional but recommended)

The `engine-rs/` directory contains a PyO3-based Rust extension (`tarok_engine`)
that accelerates game simulation 10–100× over the pure-Python implementation.
It's used for training, batch game running, and the imitation learning pipeline.

```bash
# One-time: install Rust (if not already present)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Build and install into the backend venv
make build-engine
```

`make setup` handles both steps automatically. If the extension is not installed,
the backend falls back to the pure-Python game loop — training will be slower but
still functional.

To verify the extension is installed:

```bash
cd backend && PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -c "import tarok_engine; print('OK')"
```

## Checkpoints

### Ema
The `hof_Ema_Mlakar_age316_d3f9ae44.pt` checkpoint is included in the repository.
- **Instruct + ~500k self-play games**: This model was initially trained using imitation learning on a dataset of expert games, then fine-tuned through approximately 500,000 games of self-play.
- **Winrates**: Capable of achieving over 90% winrate vs V1 and ~65% vs V3 of the StockŠkis heuristic bot.
